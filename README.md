## My process

I created the HTML first. I filled everything with placeholder texts. After doing so, I wrote the script to fetch the data from the API and load the data to the HTML. I proceeded to write the CSS with SCSS. I designed the CSS with Mobile-First workflow and move to the desktop view with the use of media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to center an image in the border of a div. I also learned how to create inner shadow and glow effect on CSS.

### Continued development

I will use the concepts and skills I learned here in other applications / software projects I planned to do. Specially with the Krio App I am thinking of doing.
